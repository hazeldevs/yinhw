			<p> &emsp; &emsp; Mr. Yin, your classes were always a blast to be a part of. Your nervously humorous teaching style and your capability to explain complex
			ideas made math a genuinely enjoyable experience for me. The jokes that were made in your class periods could not have been made in any other class I was a part of,
			and I truly believe that your outgoing, positive nature made numerous difficult or boring subjects enjoyable and engaging. I sincerely hope that you continue
			to be a great math teacher for all the generations to come through your classrooms, and that you enjoy every minute of them.</p>
